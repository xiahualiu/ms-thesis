First of all, I want to thank the project founder, Michael Arens. He provided the idea and named this project. Without him, the project would not exist. 

During the control system design, Jonathan and Krishna provided their opinions and suggestions to me. However, it almost ended up in a fight because we could not agree with each other. As a result, I combined their ideas, meanwhile absorbed the advantages of different existing techniques into the final control system design.

Byron Castillo, currently a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati, finishes the mechanical design part. Benjamin Russ is the industrial designer for the product, and he also took part in the mechanical design of Piranha.

In the end, I also want to thank the University of Cincinnati 1819 Innovation Hub and Ben Jones, the Makerspace Manager. They provided the workspace for us and also funded this project.

During my two years of study at the University of Cincinnati, Prof. Ou Ma, Prof. Donghoon Kim, Prof. Janet Dong, and Prof. Shaaban Abdallah in the College of Applied Engineering and Science had generously shared the professional knowledge with me. This invaluable knowledge and experience helped all the work done in this project.
