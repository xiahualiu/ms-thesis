% LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents and is available as free software.
% In LaTeX, you mark up the text with different tags. Opposed to "What you see is what you get" , LaTeX will arrange the text and things like links, cross references, citations for you during compilation, it makes you focus on the content itself rather than the format.
%
% This template is well scripted and is pretty straight forward in almost every thing.
% It is designed to use only necessary packages, and giving the user flexibility to add more features if needed.
